### fun story âš¡
In 2nd grade I broke my arm by falling off a slide right before the chess championship final. I was so scared of getting forfeited I ended up playing the game without telling anyone. Somehow I won! But because I wasn't celebrating, the teacher grabbed both my hands and lifted me up. Now that was a memory!
